# What is Brute?
Brute is a game engine developed by me aka Gungu for large scale game development in python. 

It has features for
- Rendering with pygame._sdl2.video
- Physics with pymunk
- Tilemaps
- Animations
- Particles
- Grass simulation (WIP)
- Vine simulation (WIP)

# How to use
Start by importing the script **"brute.py"**, and add a **data** folder for storing stuff.

In the script, start with ```brute.init()```, and give it the size and title arguements for your window

After initalizing, you need to run ```brute.update()``` every frame.

### That's it! Good luck!
